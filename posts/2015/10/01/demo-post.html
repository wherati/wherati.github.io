    <h1>&lth1&gt tag from layout version 2</h1><h1 id="third-post">Third Post</h1>
<p>This post has an explicit layout defined that is different than the default <code>post-layout</code>.</p>
<p>Also, it has <code>status: &quot;publish&quot;</code> in the front matter, so this post would appear in the production version
of the site.</p>
<p>It will show an extra <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag no present in the default layout - just for demonstration, obviously!</p>
